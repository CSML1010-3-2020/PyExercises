Yes, Uber X, Uber XL, Select, and Black allow you to request a car without having to share the ride with other Uber users. Can you tell me the prices associated with Uber X per minute and per mile. UberX is priced $0.19 per minute, and $1.00 per mile. Alright, I would like to request an UberX. Okay, your UberX ride have been requested and is on its way, make sure to check your phone for its status. Thanks, just a quick question, how much would it cost to go from the Galleria to Del Amo via UberX. Uber X for that route would be $8.00, would you like to schedule a ride for later. Thats would be great, please schedule it for 4:30 pm. The route has been successfully scheduled, your driver should arive no later than 4:40pm. Thanks for all your help. ',\n",

It looks like Akita is casual seating and Seven has options for back tables, VIP lounges, and upper level seating What about ambiance? Akita is well lit and open, they usually have music playing. Seven, depending on where you're seated, looks darker and more romantic, but with a kind of fancy bar feel. Hmm, how do the reviews match up? Akita has four out of five stars, with many compliments toward the wait staff and positive comments about the plating of the meal. Seven has a 4.5 out of 5 stars and says the wait staff can be a little short when it's busy but that the food is divine and the service is fast. Okay, so for parking, what are my options? Akita has a parking lot, Seven is right downtown so you'll want to pay for parking and arrive early or get a car to take you there. It's weird, I must be leaning towards Seven, because I don't really mind the parking inconvenience. Could you make reservations for two at Seven for me tonight? Absolutely I can. Do you want to be at Seven at 7 or something a little less, let's say, conspicuous? I'd like to do tonight at around 8pm, preferably. Okay, let me check. What kind of seating do you want? Can I get balcony seating? Let me see here...it looks like there's no available balcony seating for 8pm. What do you want to do? When is the next time I could get that seating? Not until the sushi stops being served and it's just drinks. Okay, that's not going to work. Is there just an upper level table for two that's not balcony? Looks like if you push the dinner to 8:15, they will have just that for you! Okay, quick, book it before someone else does. Alright, your reservation has been made for 8:15pm at Seven. Two people, table on the second floor. Checkin name? Garrow. Perfect. I'll send you the details in a text and also get that confirmation to you via email. Sound good? Sounds wonderful, thank you!

       "  'I want to book an Italian restaurant for a business meeting. I want it to be somewhere fancy. Reservation required and all that. Let me think...there’s Porcini and Volare’s, they’re both in downtown Louisville. How far are they from my office? Close enough to walk, if you wanted. Do either have outdoor seating? I feel like that would help me seal this business deal. Volare is mostly outdoor seating. Porcini is inside only. I’m leaning towards Volare. What’s the wine menu like at both? Volare has only a few wines available—mostly house reds—but the reviews of the wine are great. Porcini has pretty much anything you could want, but it’s cheaper stuff. Well I want there to be variety but I also want it to be expensive. My partners have good taste. What’s the dessert menu like? Volare meals automatically come with a dessert of your choice, prepared in house by a chef. Porcini has a larger dessert menu but it looks like it is mostly frozen stuff. Volare it is, then. How far out do they accept reservations? A year. Well I don’t need that long. Make me a reservation for two weeks from now—February 2nd—at 6PM. I’ll need outdoor seating for 5 people. Oh, no. It looks like there isn’t any outdoor seating available at that time for a party that size.... What else do they have? They have tables and booths inside, and seats at the bar. Seats at the bar wouldn’t be intimate enough, we wouldn’t be able to talk. Do you think booth or table seating would be better? Probably table—it would be easier to talk business without feeling too boxed in. You’re right. Go ahead and book the table. All right, you’re all set. You have a reservation at Volare for 6PM for 5 people at a table. Perfect. Thank you. ',\n",

Can they do the gluten free crust as the \"Wisconsin 6 Cheese?\" They can do that, do you want me to place the order for you? Yes, I do thank you.  I\\'m so sorry, I just input your order into the app and got the message that they do not have all of the cheeses or the sauce for the 6 Cheese pizza. Is there another type you would prefer? I really wanted that one, can they do anything similar? Yes, I can order you a traditional style GF pizza with extra cheese as your topping. Would you like anything else on top of the pizza? I would like mushrooms if possible, thanks. They have mushrooms, the app is asking me what type of sauce you want? Are there options other then marinara? Yes, quite a few. BBQ sauce, alfredo, hot sauce, garlic parmesan sauce, or robust tomato sauce. I\\'ll go with the robust tomato sauce. Okay, do you want that for pick up or delivery? Pick up, it is on my way home.  Just to verify, I am ordering you a gluten free pizza with extra cheese and mushrooms with the robust tomato sauce correct? Sounds good, just let me know when it will be ready.  Order will be ready to go in 25 minutes and your receipt will be sent to you electronically.  Thanks for the help, I appreciate it. Any time! ',\n",

How many people do we have for the lunch? I need to know how many tables to book. We have a total of 12 persons. Do you prefer one large table or multiple tables?

Well, am not sure about that but I can find out. Awesome! And we will have some folks taking beer and smoking, so have that in the list. Superb!

What does the Personal Ride entail? It is the standard Lyft car for up to 4 riders I may have to share the ride? We do offer a discounted ride if you share with others are heading in the same direction as you. What are the other options available? We have XL, Lux, Lux Black, Lux Black XL in addition to the Lyft option. How much would the XL cost? $45-50 for the 39 minutes That is a jump in price. What is the difference? It lets you request a high-end car for a more luxurious ride.  Well that would be nice after getting off the plane.

It also is more spacious and can seat up to 6 if you need.  That does sound pretty sweet post flight but probably overkill. Lets go with the XL. I'd be happy to book that for you.

Asiate has a contemporary and modern menu by Executive Chef Cyril Renaud. They do offer a Wagyu beef steak that I think you would enjoy. I like what I hear and would like to book this restaurant.  Very well, I will make reservations. What time would you like to dine?  I would like to go out for drinks after our meal so not too late. Book the reservation for 9pm.

       "  \"Can you make reservations for Izzy's steakhouse for Monday Night. Steve Burns and Harold Smith are visiting and would like to schedule a dinner. They will be bringing 5 of their top Sales Managers. So we are looking for a place that can accommodate a large number of people Sure, how many people will this reservation be for?  15 people Great, what time would you like this reservation for? Make it 8:00 pm , we can meet in the bar area around 7:00 I just called Izzy's steakhouse and they can accommodate the large party for Monday but there are no reservations at 8:00, but I do need to tell you they do not have a bar area. Do you still want me to make the reservation? Well, if they do not have a bar, and 8:00 is not an option, let's see if they can accommodate a 7:00 reservation I spoke tot the manager and he stated that he can accommodate 7:00 but you would have to have a minimum number of 30 people because the only space that is available due to short notice is a private room. It's ok I think we will pass on Izzy's Steakhouse. Can you look up any other steakhouses in the area with good ratings. Sure I found Mckormicks Steak house, I happen to know that they have a large bar area. Would you like me to call them and ask if they can accommodate our large party? No I had a bad experience with that place, can you look for another place? I found O'hara Steak house, would you like me to call them and inquire? Yes that would be great, I heard great things about that place, its a little bit further than i wanted to go, but why not.  I was able to confirm that they can accommodate our large party. They did mention that we need to put a deposit down in order to hold the reservation.  Oh that is fine, how much of a deposit are they asking for? They require a $200 deposit to secure your table.  Yes go ahead and book the reservation. Can you also ask them to reserve some seating in the bar area? Also can you let them know that all drinks will be charged to the same dinner bill. Sure thing! I just called back and they told me that they have a nice quiet area by the fire place in the bar for 7:00 and dinner reservations at 8:00pm That is great, thank you so much for doing this.  You are welcome.  The address is 12324 main street  \",\n",
